<h1 id="jialun-zhang">Jialun Zhang</h1>
<p>I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Penn State, advised by <a href="https://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/">Dr. Gang Tan</a>. I also obtained my M.S. in Computer Science at Penn State. Before that, I did my Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Mathematics at Sun Yat-sen University.</p>
<p>I am interested in the power of abstractions in programming languages that make programmers&rsquo; life easier. I did my Master&rsquo;s thesis on a formal grammar that can describe parsers for file formats. Now I am looking into exploiting the concept of isolation/sandboxes at a language level.</p>
